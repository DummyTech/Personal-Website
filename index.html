            <h2>Who am I?</h2>
            <p>Well for privacy reasons I can't tell you spesificly who am I, but I can share some things that are more general. So I'm just a regular human seeking the meaning of life, doing good deeds for other people who need helps and try to learn from my mistakes. All of my hobbies where learned through internet.</p>

            <h2>What type of person am I?</h2>
            <p>Well. Umm, I'm more leaning to introvert so I don't talk too much but if I'm being questioned then I will speak. I like doing some random projects because it feels different each time. There are new challenges to be conquered and new skills to acquire. I know, It's a pain to deal with problems but it feels relieved when you knock out your biggest enemy in life. I like road trips also. Sometimes.</p>
